Paragraph
It looks like the doublerAppend function scales better.
It only goes up by a little bit of time everytime.
The doublerInsert goes up by much more time everytime, with the biggest one
being over a second to complete.

Extra
The .unshift() version of the functions take longer because it is actually
0(n) while the .push() version is 0(1). Because unshift() has to 
increment all the elements that already present in the Array. 
But, push() has to insert an element at the end of the array, 
so none of the Array elements' index has to change.
